# MatUni
ðŸŽ¯ This the project of a website to aid those who want to learn college level mathematics and physics, this is a non-profit project and by now we are focusing mainly on the front end
and on the database of problems and solutions, as this is a personal project we dont have a release date but feel free to contact us with you want. Our goal is to provide solutions
to most book exercises without a paywall because we believe education should be free, we also will create a roadmap to learn each individual subject andan automated test maker for 
those who want to evaluate themselves in each content. We will create the website firstly in portuguese because we want to help new college students in Brazil but we have plans 
to translate it to english.
